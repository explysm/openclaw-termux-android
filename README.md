# ARCHIVE NOTICE
After some major consideration, I've decided to archive this project & stop development as it's become too difficult to maintain. You can still run original OpenClaw using the clipboard fix. (see troubleshooting and fixes)

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> OpenClaw Android is no where near ready to use daily; It is mostly a **proof of concept** of an idea i had this morning.
>
> This app is mostly for those who plan to run openclaw on a "server phone."
